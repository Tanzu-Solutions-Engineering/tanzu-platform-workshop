The developer and app operator experience on Tanzu Platform for Kubernetes is centered around four main verbs:
- Build: Automating the process of creating secure, consistent application container images
  - Environment and show Build vs Deploy
- Bind: The ability to discover and inject external application service credentials (databases, messaging services, etc.) to your application
- Deploy: Simplify the process of getting applications running on Kubernetes without having to understand Kubernetes manifests
- Scale: Adjust resources allocated to your application instances, and add resliance with multiple application instances distributed across availability zones

This workshop will explore how these verbs manifest in Tanzu Plaform for Kubernetes.
